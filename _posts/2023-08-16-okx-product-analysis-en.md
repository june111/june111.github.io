## 6 Distinctive Features

### 6.1 Account Evolution

OKX pioneered the idea of a Unified Account. After a year of development, the Unified Account system entered public testing in December 2020. Over two years, it underwent thorough exploration and optimization, leading to the retirement of the Classic Account in January 2022. This marked the full adoption of the Unified Account system. This innovation garnered attention and motivated other exchanges to introduce similar Unified Account solutions. OKX's commitment to innovation has set an industry benchmark.

In June 2022, Binance launched its Portfolio Margin Program, enabling traders to use multiple assets as collateral. This feature is applicable to trading in USDⓈ-M Futures, COIN-M Futures, and Cross Margin Wallets.

#### 6.1.1 Classic Account System（2018）

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/post/2023-08-16/classic-account-system-en.jpg">
![Classic Account System]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/post/2023-08-16/classic-account-system-en.jpg)
</a>

In the Classic Account System, accounts are grouped by business type to manage risks and track finances effectively. These categories include Spot, Futures, Index, and P2P Accounts.

* Spot Account: Users shift their crypto from the P2P Account to the Spot Account for "spot trading," which also enables deposits and withdrawals.
* Futures Account / Index Account: For futures or index trading, users move cryptocurrencies from the Spot Account to the Futures or Index Account.
* P2P Account: Acquired digital assets from fiat transactions are held in this account.

#### 6.1.2 Unified Account System（2023）

<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/post/2023-08-16/unified-account-system-en.jpg">
![Unified Account System]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/post/2023-08-16/unified-account-system-en.jpg)
</a>

The Unified Account System simplifies user actions, minimizing the need for frequent fund transfers.

Users can conveniently carry out key activities directly within their trading account, including deposits, withdrawals, spot trading, perpetual swaps, futures trading, options trading, margin trading, and fiat trading,  offering an all-in-one trading experience.

The funding account handles tasks like deposits, withdrawals, IEO participation (Jumpstart), loans, and activities such as savings and staking. This ensures effective fund utilization and secure management.

The introduction of the finance account further enhances the trading environment for users, facilitating their participation in diverse financial activities and elevating the overall platform experience.

### 6.2 Goals of Account Structure Enhancement

#### 6.2.1 Profit and Loss Offset

OKX's Unified Account System has four new account modes: Simple, Single-currency Margin, Multi-currency Margin, and Portfolio Margin. With this innovation, users can trade various digital asset derivatives in one account and share margins between different product lines.

![Account modes]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/post/2023-08-16/pnl-en.png)
</a>

Margin sharing helps lower liquidation risk in volatile markets, strengthening risk resistance. But if liquidation happens, losses could be higher compared to non-shared margins. This follows the "shared glory, shared loss" principle.

</a>

#### 6.2.2 Enhancing User Experience

In the Classic Account, spot trading involves two steps: first, buy cryptocurrencies using the Point-to-Point Account, then transfer to the Spot Account. For futures trading, funds need to be moved again to the Futures Account, making it three steps.

In contrast, the Unified Account streamlines this by enabling direct spot trading after deposit. This removes the need for multiple fund transfers, simplifying the process, enhancing user experience, and boosting trading efficiency. This also reduces the learning curve, making trading easier for more users and promoting growth on OKX.

## 7 Summary and Insights 

1. OKX was among the earliest trading platforms to introduce Bitcoin futures right from the start, establishing itself as a pioneer in the realm of futures trading. Through derivative trading, it rapidly expanded its business. In a competitive landscape with Binance, Huobi, and OKX as the major players, OKX stood out with its robust futures liquidity.
2. OKX's innovative approach is also evident in its unique Unified Account. This initiative not only enhances efficient fund utilization and risk management for futures trading but also simplifies user participation, thereby enhancing the overall user experience. This innovation provides users with a more streamlined method of operation and sets a new industry benchmark.
3. Another standout feature of OKX is how it combines wallet and exchange functions in one app. This blend allows users to easily manage their assets and conduct trades all in one place, creating a balanced mix of centralization and decentralization. As a result, users have more choices and a more convenient experience.
4. A pivotal factor contributing to OKX's success is its rapid iteration. Following a similar approach to Binance, OKX introduces new app versions weekly, consistently fine-tuning and enhancing the user experience. Even if minor issues arise, OKX responds swiftly, releasing fixes promptly to ensure user security and a smooth experience.
